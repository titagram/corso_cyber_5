Introduction To IDS/IPS
In network security monitoring (NSM) operations, the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) is paramount. The purpose of these systems is not only to identify potential threats but also to mitigate their impact.

An IDS is a device or application that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations and produces reports primarily to a management station. Such a system gives us a clear sense of what's happening within our network, ensuring we have visibility on any potentially harmful actions. It should be noted that an IDS doesn't prevent an intrusion but alerts us when one occurs.

The IDS operates in two main modes: signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection. In signature-based detection, the IDS recognizes bad patterns, such as malware signatures and previously identified attack patterns. However, this method is limited to only known threats. For this reason, we also implement anomaly-based detection, which establishes a baseline of normal behavior and sends an alert when it detects behavior deviating from this baseline. It's a more proactive approach but is susceptible to false positives, hence why we use both methods to balance each other out.
On the other hand, an IPS sits directly behind the firewall and provides an additional layer of protection. It does not just passively monitor the network traffic, but actively prevents any detected potential threats. Such a system doesn't just alert us of intruders, but also actively stops them from entering.

An IPS also operates in a similar mode to IDS, offering both signature-based and anomaly-based detection. Once a potential threat is detected, it takes actions such as dropping malicious packets, blocking network traffic, and resetting the connection. The goal is to interrupt or halt activities that are deemed dangerous to our network or against our policy.
When deploying IDS and IPS, they are typically integrated into the network at different points, each having its optimal place depending on its function and the overall network design. Both IDS and IPS devices are generally positioned behind the firewall, closer to the resources they protect. As they both work by examining network traffic, it makes sense to place them where they can see as much of the relevant traffic as possible, which is typically on the internal network side of the firewall.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) passively monitor network traffic, detecting potential threats and generating alerts. By placing them behind the firewall, we can ensure they're analyzing traffic that has already passed the first line of defense, allowing us to focus on potentially more subtle or complex threats that have bypassed the firewall.
Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), on the other hand, actively intervene to stop detected threats. This means they need to be placed at a point in the network where they can not only see potentially malicious traffic but also have the authority to stop it. This is usually achieved by placing them inline on the network, often directly behind the firewall.
The deployment may vary based on the network's specific requirements and the kind of traffic we need to monitor. IDS/IPS can also be implemented on the host level, known as Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) and Host-based Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS), which monitor the individual host's inbound and outbound traffic for any suspicious activity.

Please note that the placement of these systems is an integral part of a defense-in-depth strategy, where multiple layers of security measures are used to protect the network. The exact architecture will depend on various factors, including the nature of the network, the sensitivity of the data, and the threat landscape.

IDS/IPS Updates
Moreover, to ensure these systems perform at their best, we consistently update them with the latest threat signatures and fine-tune their anomaly detection algorithms. This requires a diligent, ongoing effort from our security team, but it's absolutely essential given the continually evolving threat landscape.

It's also important to mention the role of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems in our network security monitoring operations. By collecting and aggregating logs from IDS and IPS along with other devices in our network, we can correlate events (analyzing the relationships) from different sources and use advanced analytics to detect complex, coordinated attacks. This way, we have a complete, unified view of our network's security, enabling us to respond quickly to threats.

Coming Up
In this module, we will explore the fundamentals of Suricata, Snort, and Zeek, along with providing insights into signature development and intrusion detection for each of these systems.


Suricata Fundamentals
Regarded as a potent instrument for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and Network Security Monitoring (NSM), Suricata represents a cornerstone of network security. This open-source powerhouse, managed and developed by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF), is a testament to the strength of a community-led, non-profit initiative.

The objective of Suricata is to dissect every iota of network traffic, seeking potential signs of malicious activities. Its strength lies in the ability to not only conduct a sweeping evaluation of our network's condition but also delve into the details of individual application-layer transactions. The key to Suricata's successful operation lies in an intricately designed set of rules. These guidelines direct Suricata's analysis process, identifying potential threats and areas of interest. Equipped to perform at high velocities on both off-the-shelf and specifically designed hardware, Suricata's efficiency is second to none.

Suricata Operation Modes
Suricata operates in four (4) distinct modes:

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) mode positions Suricata as a silent observer. In this capacity, Suricata meticulously examines traffic, flagging potential attacks but refraining from any form of intervention. By providing an in-depth view of network activities and accelerating response times, this mode augments network visibility, albeit without offering direct protection.

In the Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) mode, Suricata adopts a proactive stance. All network traffic must pass through Suricata's stringent checks and is only granted access to the internal network upon Suricata's approval. This mode bolsters security by proactively thwarting attacks before they penetrate our internal network. Deploying Suricata in IPS mode demands an intimate understanding of the network landscape to prevent the inadvertent blocking of legitimate traffic. Furthermore, each rule activation necessitates rigorous testing and validation. While this mode enhances security, the inspection process may introduce latency.

The Intrusion Detection Prevention System (IDPS) mode brings together the best of both IDS and IPS. While Suricata continues to passively monitor traffic, it possesses the ability to actively transmit RST packets in response to abnormal activities. This mode strikes a balance between active protection and maintaining low latency, crucial for seamless network operations.

In its Network Security Monitoring (NSM) mode, Suricata transitions into a dedicated logging mechanism, eschewing active or passive traffic analysis or prevention capabilities. It meticulously logs every piece of network information it encounters, providing a valuable wealth of data for retrospective security incident investigations, despite the high volume of data generated.

Suricata Inputs
Regarding Suricata inputs, there are two main categories:

Offline Input: This involves reading PCAP files for processing previously captured packets in the LibPCAP file format. It is not only advantageous for conducting post-mortem data examination but also instrumental when experimenting with various rule sets and configurations.

Live Input: Live input can be facilitated via LibPCAP, where packets are read directly from network interfaces. However, LibPCAP is somewhat hamstrung by its performance limitations and lack of load-balancing capabilities. For inline operations, NFQ and AF_PACKET options are available. NFQ, a Linux-specific inline IPS mode, collaborates with IPTables to divert packets from the kernel space into Suricata for detailed scrutiny. Commonly used inline, NFQ necessitates drop rules for Suricata to effectively obstruct packets. Conversely, AF_PACKET provides a performance improvement over LibPCAP and supports multi-threading. Nevertheless, it's not compatible with older Linux distributions and can't be employed inline if the machine is also tasked with routing packets.

Please note that there are other, less commonly used or more advanced inputs available.

Suricata Outputs
Suricata creates multiple outputs, including logs, alerts, and additional network-related data such as DNS requests and network flows. One of the most critical outputs is EVE, a JSON formatted log that records a wide range of event types including alerts, HTTP, DNS, TLS metadata, drop, SMTP metadata, flow, netflow, and more. Tools such as Logstash can easily consume this output, facilitating data analysis.

We might encounter Unified2 Suricata output, which is essentially a Snort binary alert format, enabling integration with other software that leverages Unified2. Any Unified2 output can be read using Snort’s u2spewfoo tool, which is a straightforward and effective method to gain insight into the alert data.

Let's now navigate to the bottom of this section and click on "Click here to spawn the target system!". Then, let's SSH into the Target IP using the provided credentials. The vast majority of the commands covered from this point up to end of this section can be replicated inside the target, offering a more comprehensive grasp of the topics presented.

Configuring Suricata & Custom Rules
Once we've accessed the deployed Suricata instance over SSH, we can get an overview of all the rule files with a simple execution command.

Rules might be commented out, meaning they aren't loaded and don't affect the system. This usually happens when a new version of the rule comes into play or if the threat associated with the rule becomes outdated or irrelevant.

Each rule usually involves specific variables, such as $HOME_NET and $EXTERNAL_NET. The rule examines traffic from the IP addresses specified in the $HOME_NET variable heading towards the IP addresses in the $EXTERNAL_NET variable.

These variables can be defined in the suricata.yaml configuration file.

This allows us to customize these variables according to our specific network environment and even define our own variables.

Finally, to configure Suricata to load signatures from a custom rules file, such as local.rules in the /home/htb-student directory, we would execute the below.

  Suricata Fundamentals
titagram@htb[/htb]$ sudo vim /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
Add /home/htb-student/local.rules to rule-files:
Press the Esc key
Enter :wq and then, press the Enter key
The local.rules file that resides in the /home/htb-student directory of this section's target already contains a Suricata rule. This rule is adequate for this section's learning objectives. We will elaborate more on Suricata rule development in the next section.

Hands-on With Suricata Inputs
With Suricata inputs, we can experiment with both offline and live input:

For offline input (reading PCAP files - suspicious.pcap in this case), the following command needs to be executed, and Suricata will create various logs (mainly eve.json, fast.log, and stats.log).

  
titagram@htb[/htb]$ suricata -r /home/htb-student/pcaps/suspicious.pcap

An alternative command can be executed to bypass checksums (-k flag) and log in a different directory (-l flag).

  
titagram@htb[/htb]$ suricata -r /home/htb-student/pcaps/suspicious.pcap -k none -l .

5/7/2023 -- 13:37:43 - <Notice> - Pcap-file module read 1 files, 5172 packets, 3941260 bytes
For live input, we can try Suricata’s (Live) LibPCAP mode as follows.

For Suricata in Inline (NFQ) mode, the following command should be executed first.

  
titagram@htb[/htb]$ sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE
Then, we should be able to execute the following.

  
titagram@htb[/htb]$ sudo suricata -q 0
5/7/2023 -- 13:52:38 - <Notice> - This is Suricata version 6.0.13 RELEASE running in SYSTEM mode

To observe Suricata dealing with "live" traffic, let's establish an additional SSH connection and utilize tcpreplay to replay network traffic from a PCAP file (suspicious.pcap in this case).

  Suricata Fundamentals
titagram@htb[/htb]$ sudo  tcpreplay -i ens160 /home/htb-student/pcaps/suspicious.pcap
^C User interrupt...
sendpacket_abort
Actual: 730 packets (663801 bytes) sent in 22.84 seconds
Rated: 29060.3 Bps, 0.232 Mbps, 31.95 pps
Statistics for network device: ens160
        Successful packets:        729
        Failed packets:            0
        Truncated packets:         0
        Retried packets (ENOBUFS): 0
        Retried packets (EAGAIN):  0
Then, feel free to terminate both tcpreplay and Suricata. The logs from the observed (replayed) traffic will be available at /var/log/suricata

The -i option helps Suricata choose the best input option. In the case of Linux, the best input option is AF_PACKET. If pcap mode is needed, the --pcap option is recommended. Configuration of (Live) LibPCAP can be achieved via the suricata.yaml file, including settings for buffer size, BPF or tcpdump filters, checksum validation, threads, promiscuous mode, snap length, etc.

Hands-on With Suricata Outputs
Suricata records a variety of data into logs that reside in the /var/log/suricata directory by default. For us to access and manipulate these logs, we require root-level access. Among these logs, we find the eve.json, fast.log, and stats.log files, which provide invaluable insight into the network activity. Let's delve into each:

eve.json: This file is Suricata's recommended output and contains JSON objects, each carrying diverse information such as timestamps, flow_id, event_type, and more. Try inspecting the content of old_eve.json residing at /var/log/suricata as follows.

If we wish to filter out only alert events, for example, we can utilize the jq command-line JSON processor as follows.

  
titagram@htb[/htb]$ cat /var/log/suricata/old_eve.json | jq -c 'select(.event_type == "alert")'
{"timestamp":"2023-07-06T08:34:35.003163+0000","flow_id":1959965318909019,"in_iface":"ens160","event_type":"alert","src_ip":"10.9.24.101","src_port":51833,"d est_ip":"10.9.24.1","dest_port":53,"proto":"UDP","tx_id":0,"alert":{"action":"allowed","gid":1,"signature_id":1,"rev":0,"signature":"Known bad DNS lookup, possible Dridex infection","category":"","severity":3},"dns":{"query":[{"type":"query","id":6430,"rrname":"adv.epostoday.uk","rrtype":"A","tx_id":0,"opcode":0}    ]},"app_proto":"dns","flow":{"pkts_toserver":1,"pkts_toclient":0,"bytes_toserver":76,"bytes_toclient":0,"start":"2023-07-06T08:34:35.003163+0000"}}
If we wish to identify the earliest DNS event, for example, we can utilize the jq command-line JSON processor as follows.

  
titagram@htb[/htb]$ cat /var/log/suricata/old_eve.json | jq -c 'select(.event_type == "dns")' | head -1 | jq .
{
 "timestamp": "2023-07-06T08:34:35.003163+0000",
 "flow_id": 1959965318909019,
 "in_iface": "ens160",
  "event_type": "dns",
  "src_ip": "10.9.24.101",
 "src_port": 51833,
 "dest_ip": "10.9.24.1",
 "dest_port": 53,
 "proto": "UDP",
 "dns": {
  "type": "query",
  "id": 6430,
	 "rrname": "adv.epostoday.uk",
	 "rrtype": "A",
	 "tx_id": 0,
	"opcode": 0
 }
}
We can also use similar commands to filter for other event types like TLS and SSH.

flow_id: This is a unique identifier assigned by Suricata to each network flow. A flow, in Suricata terms, is defined as a set of IP packets passing through a network interface in a specific direction and between a given pair of source and destination endpoints. Each of these flows gets a unique flow_id. This identifier helps us track and correlate various events related to the same network flow in the EVE JSON log. Using flow_id, we can associate different pieces of information related to the same flow, such as alerts, network transactions, and packets, providing a cohesive view of what is happening on a specific communication channel.

pcap_cnt: This is a counter that Suricata increments for each packet it processes from the network traffic or from a PCAP file (in offline mode). pcap_cnt allows us to trace a packet back to its original order in the PCAP file or network stream. This is beneficial in understanding the sequence of network events as they occurred. It can help to precisely pinpoint when an alert was triggered in relation to other packets, which can provide valuable context in an investigation.

fast.log: This is a text-based log format that records alerts only and is enabled by default. Try inspecting the content of old_fast.log residing at /var/log/suricata as follows.

  
titagram@htb[/htb]$ cat /var/log/suricata/old_fast.log

stats.log: This is a human-readable statistics log, which can be particularly useful while debugging Suricata deployments. Try inspecting the content of old_stats.log residing at /var/log/suricata as follows.

For those of us who want a more focused output strategy, there's an option to deactivate the comprehensive EVE output and activate particular outputs instead. Take http-log, for instance. By activating this, every time Suricata is run and encounters HTTP events, a fresh http.log file will be generated.

Hands-on With Suricata Outputs - File Extraction
Suricata, has an underused yet highly potent feature - file extraction. This feature allows us to capture and store files transferred over a number of different protocols, providing invaluable data for threat hunting, forensics, or simply data analysis.

Here's how we go about enabling file extraction in Suricata.

We start by making changes to the Suricata configuration file (suricata.yaml). In this file, we'll find a section named file-store. This is where we tell Suricata how to handle the files it extracts. Specifically, we need to set version to 2, enabled to yes, and the force-filestore option also to yes. The resulting section should look something like this.

  Suricata Fundamentals
file-store:
  version: 2
  enabled: yes
  force-filestore: yes
In the same file-store section, we define where Suricata stores the extracted files. We set the dir option to the directory of our choice.

As a quick exercise, let's enable file extraction and run Suricata on the /home/htb-student/pcaps/vm-2.pcap file from www.netresec.com.

In accordance with the guidelines put forth in Suricata's documentation, file extraction isn't an automatic process that occurs without our explicit instructions. It's fundamentally crucial for us to craft a specific rule that instructs Suricata when and what kind of files it should extract.

The simplest rule we can add to our local.rules file to experiment with file extraction is the following.

  Suricata Fundamentals
alert http any any -> any any (msg:"FILE store all"; filestore; sid:2; rev:1;)
If we configured Suricata correctly, multiple files will be stored inside the filestore directory.

Let's run Suricata on the /home/htb-student/pcaps/vm-2.pcap file.

  Suricata Fundamentals
titagram@htb[/htb]$ suricata -r /home/htb-student/pcaps/vm-2.pcap

7/7/2023 -- 06:25:57 - <Notice> - Pcap-file module read 1 files, 803 packets, 683915 bytes
We will notice that eve.json, fast.log, stats.log, and suricata.log were created, alongside a new directory called filestore. filestore's content in terms of the files it contains can be inspected as follows.

Again in accordance with the guidelines put forth in Suricata's documentation the file-store module uses its own log directory (default: filestore in the default logging directory) and logs files using the SHA256 of the contents as the filename. Each file is then placed in a directory named 00 to ff where the directory shares the first 2 characters of the filename. For example, if the SHA256 hex string of an extracted file starts with f9bc6d... the file we be placed in the directory filestore/f9.

If we wanted to inspect, for example, the /21/21742fc621f83041db2e47b0899f5aea6caa00a4b67dbff0aae823e6817c5433 file inside the filestore directory, we could use the xxd tool as follows.

Live Rule Reloading Feature & Updating Suricata Rulesets
Live rule reloading is a crucial feature in Suricata that allows us to update our ruleset without interrupting ongoing traffic inspection. This feature provides continuous monitoring and minimizes the chances of missing any malicious activity.

To enable live rule reloading in Suricata, we need to configure our Suricata configuration file (suricata.yaml). In the suricata.yaml file, we should locate the detect-engine section and set the value of the reload parameter to true. It looks something like this:

  Suricata Fundamentals
detect-engine:
  - reload: true
Proceed to execute the following kill command, which will signal the Suricata process (determined by $(pidof suricata)) to refresh its rule set without necessitating a complete restart.

  Suricata Fundamentals
titagram@htb[/htb]$ sudo kill -usr2 $(pidof suricata)
This modification tells Suricata to check for changes in the ruleset periodically and apply them without needing to restart the service.

Most of the commands below cannot be replicated inside this section's target since they require internet connectivity.

Updating Suricata's ruleset can be performed using the suricata-update tool. We can perform a simple update to the Suricata ruleset using the following command.

Validating Suricata's Configuration
Validation of Suricata's configuration is also an essential part of maintaining the robustness of our IDS/IPS setup. To validate the configuration, we can use the -T option provided by the Suricata command. This command runs a test to check if the configuration file is valid and all files referenced in the configuration are accessible.

Here is how we can do this.

  Suricata Fundamentals
titagram@htb[/htb]$ sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

Suricata Rule Development Part 1
At its core, a rule in Suricata serves as a directive, instructing the engine to actively watch for certain markers in the network traffic. When such specific markers appear, we will receive a notification.

Suricata rules are not exclusively focused on the detection of nefarious activities or potentially harmful traffic. In many instances, rules can be designed to furnish network defenders or blue team members with critical insights or contextual data regarding ongoing network activity.

The specificity or generality of the rules is in our hands. Striking a balance is paramount to, say, identify variations of a certain malware strain while evading false positives.

The development of these rules often leverages crucial information provided by the infosec communities and threat intelligence. However, it's worth noting that each rule we deploy consumes a portion of the host's CPU and memory resources. Hence, Suricata provides specific guidelines for writing effective rules.

Suricata Rule Anatomy
A sample Suricata rule can be found below. Let's break it down.

  Suricata Rule Development Part 1
action protocol from_ip port -> to_ip port (msg:"Known malicious behavior, possible X malware infection"; content:"some thing"; content:"some other thing"; sid:10000001; rev:1;)
Header (action protocol from_ip port -> to_ip port part): The header section of a rule encapsulates the intended action of the rule, along with the protocol where the rule is expected to be applied. Additionally, it includes IP addresses, port information, and an arrow indicating traffic directionality.

action instructs Suricata on what steps to take if the contents match. This could range from generating an alert (alert), logging the traffic without an alert (log), ignoring the packet (pass), dropping the packet in IPS mode (drop), or sending TCP RST packets (reject).
protocol can vary, including tcp, udp, icmp, ip, http, tls, smb, or dns.
Traffic directionality is declared using rule host variables (such as $HOME_NET, $EXTERNAL_NET, etc. that we saw inside suricata.yaml) and rule direction. The direction arrow between the two IP-Port pairs informs Suricata about the traffic flow.
Examples:
Outbound: $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET 9090
Inbound: $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 8443
Bidirectional: $EXTERNAL_NET any <> $HOME_NET any
Rule ports define the ports at which the traffic for this rule will be evaluated.
Examples:
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET 9443
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET $UNCOMMON_PORTS
$UNCOMMON_PORTS can be defined inside suricata.yaml
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET [8443,8080,7001:7002,!8443]
Rule message & content ((msg:"Known malicious behavior, possible X malware infection"; content:"some thing"; content:"some other thing"; part): The rule message & content section contains the message we wish to be displayed to the analysts or ourselves when an activity we want to be notified about is detected. content are the segments of the traffic that we deem essential for such detections.

Rule message (msg) is an arbitrary text displayed when the rule is triggered. Ideally, the rule messages we create should contain details about malware architecture, family, and action.
flow identifies the originator and responder. Always remember, when crafting rules, to have the engine monitor "established" tcp sessions.
Examples:
alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.0/24 22 (msg:"SSH connection attempt"; flow:to_server; sid:1001;)
alert udp 10.0.0.0/24 any -> any 53 (msg:"DNS query"; flow:from_client; sid:1002;)
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 80 (msg:"Potential HTTP-based attack"; flow:established,to_server; sid:1003;)
dsize matches using the payload size of the packet. It relies on TCP segment length, not the total packet length.
Example: alert http any any -> any any (msg:"Large HTTP response"; dsize:>10000; content:"HTTP/1.1 200 OK"; sid:2003;)
Rule content comprises unique values that help identify specific network traffic or activities. Suricata matches these unique content values in packets for detection.
Example: content:"User-Agent|3a 20|Go-http-client/1.1|0d 0a|Accept-Encoding|3a 20|gzip";
|3a 20|: This represents the hexadecimal representation of the characters ":", followed by a space character. It is used to match the exact byte sequence in the packet payload.
|0d 0a|: This represents the hexadecimal representation of the characters "\r\n", which signifies the end of a line in HTTP headers.
By using Rule Buffers, we don't have to search the entire packet for every content match. This saves time and resources. More details can be found here: https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rules/http-keywords.html
Example: alert http any any -> any any (http.accept; content:"image/gif"; sid:1;)
http.accept: Sticky buffer to match on the HTTP Accept header. Only contains the header value. The \r\n after the header are not part of the buffer.
Rule options act as additional modifiers to aid detection, helping Suricata locate the exact location of contents.
nocase ensures rules are not bypassed through case changes.
Example: alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Detect HTTP traffic with user agent Mozilla"; content:"User-Agent: Mozilla"; nocase; sid:8001;)
offset informs Suricata about the start position inside the packet for matching.
Example: alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Detect specific protocol command"; content:"|01 02 03|"; offset:0; depth:5; sid:3003;)
This rule triggers an alert when Suricata detects a specific protocol command represented by the byte sequence |01 02 03| in the TCP payload. The offset:0 keyword sets the content match to start from the beginning of the payload, and depth:5 specifies a length of five bytes to be considered for matching.
distance specifies where Suricata should begin searching for the next content pattern, measured from the end of the previous content match. It only applies when multiple content keywords are defined within the same rule; it has no effect if there is only one content statement. In most cases, it is paired with the within keyword to establish a bounded search window.
Example: alert http any any -> any any (msg:"Detect suspicious URL path after HTTP method"; content:"GET"; offset:0; depth:4; content:"/admin"; distance:10; within:80; sid:3001;)
This rule instructs Suricata to first match the string "GET" within the first four bytes of the HTTP request payload (offset:0; depth:4). Once that match occurs, distance:10 enforces a minimum separation of 10 bytes before searching for the next content. From that anchor point, within:80 limits the search to the next 80 bytes. Consequently, the string "/admin" must begin at least 10 bytes after the end of "GET" and no later than 80 bytes beyond that. If /admin appears closer than 10 bytes or farther than 80 bytes from the previous match, the rule will not trigger.
Rule metadata (sid:10000001; rev:1; part):

reference provides us with a lead, a trail that takes us back to the original source of information that inspired the creation of the rule.
sid (signature ID). The unique quality of this numeric identifier makes it essential for the rule writer to manage and distinguish between rules.
revision offers insights into the rule's version. It serves as an indicator of the evolution of the rule over time, highlighting modifications and enhancements made.
Having discussed the crux of Suricata rules, it's now time to shed light on a powerful tool in rule development: PCRE or Perl Compatible Regular Expression. Utilizing PCRE can be a game-changer when crafting rules. To employ PCRE, we use the pcre statement, which is then followed by a regular expression. Keep in mind that the PCRE should be encased in leading and trailing forward slashes, with any flags positioned after the last slash.

Also, note that anchors are positioned after and before the encasing slashes, and certain characters demand escaping with a backslash. A piece of advice from the trenches - steer clear from authoring a rule that relies solely on PCRE.

Example: alert http any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg: "ATTACK [PTsecurity] Apache Continuum <= v1.4.2 CMD Injection"; content: "POST"; http_method; content: "/continuum/saveInstallation.action"; offset: 0; depth: 34; http_uri; content: "installation.varValue="; nocase; http_client_body; pcre: !"/^\$?[\sa-z\\_0-9.-]*(\&|$)/iRP"; flow: to_server, established;sid: 10000048; rev: 1;)
Firstly, the rule triggers on HTTP traffic (alert http) from any source and destination to any port on the home network (any any -> $HOME_NET any).
The msg field gives a human-readable description of what the alert is for, namely ATTACK [PTsecurity] Apache Continuum <= v1.4.2 CMD Injection.
Next, the rule checks for the POST string in the HTTP method using the content and http_method keywords. The rule will match if the HTTP method used is a POST request.
The content keyword is then used with http_uri to match the URI /continuum/saveInstallation.action, starting at offset 0 and going to a depth of 34 bytes. This specifies the targeted endpoint, which in this case is the saveInstallation action of the Apache Continuum application.
Following this, another content keyword searches for installation.varValue= in the HTTP client body, case insensitively (nocase). This string may be part of the command injection payload that the attacker is trying to deliver.
Next, we see a pcre keyword, which is used to implement Perl Compatible Regular Expressions.
! at the beginning signifies that the rule will trigger when the match does not occur.
^ marks the start of the line.
\$? checks for an optional dollar sign at the start.
[\sa-z\\_0-9.-]* matches zero or more (*) of the characters in the set. The set includes:
\s a space
a-z any lowercase letter
\\ a backslash
_ an underscore
0-9 any digit
. a period
- a hyphen
(\&|$) checks for either an ampersand or the end of the line.
/iRP at the end indicates this is an inverted match, case insensitive (i), and relative to the buffer position (RP).
Finally, the flow keyword is used to specify that the rule triggers on established, inbound traffic towards the server.
For those who seek to broaden their understanding of Suricata rules and delve deeper into rule development, the following resource serves as a comprehensive guide: https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/rules/index.html.

IDS/IPS Rule Development Approaches
When it comes to creating rules for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), there's an art and a science behind it. It requires a comprehensive understanding of network protocols, malware behaviors, system vulnerabilities, and the threat landscape in general.

A key strategy that we employ while crafting these rules involves the detection of specific elements within network traffic that are unique to malware. This is often referred to as signature-based detection, and it's the classic approach that most IDS/IPS rely on. Signatures can range from simple patterns in packet payloads, such as the detection of a specific command or a distinctive string associated with a particular malware, to complex patterns that match a series of packets or packet characteristics. Signature-based detection is highly effective when dealing with known threats as it can identify these threats with high precision, however, it struggles to detect novel threats for which no signature exists yet.

Another approach focuses on identifying specific behaviors that are characteristic to malware. This is typically referred to as anomaly-based or behavior-based detection. For instance, a certain HTTP response size constantly appearing within a threshold, or a specific beaconing interval might be indicative of a malware communication pattern. Other behaviors can include unusually high volumes of data transfers and uncommon ports being used. The advantage of this approach is its ability to potentially identify zero-day attacks or novel threats that would not be detected by signature-based systems. However, it also tends to have higher false-positive rates due to the dynamic nature of network behaviors.

A third approach that we utilize in crafting IDS/IPS rules is stateful protocol analysis. This technique involves understanding and tracking the state of network protocols and comparing observed behaviors to the expected state transitions of these protocols. By keeping track of the state of each connection, we can identify deviations from expected behavior which might suggest a malicious activity.

Let's now navigate to the bottom of this section and click on "Click here to spawn the target system!". Then, let's SSH (or RDP) into the Target IP using the provided credentials. The vast majority of the commands covered from this point up to end of this section can be replicated inside the target, offering a more comprehensive grasp of the topics presented.

Please wait for approximately 5-6 minutes before initiating a connection using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). You may have to try 2-3 times before a successful RDP connection is established!

Now, we will explore several examples of Suricata rule development to gain a solid understanding of the different approaches we can take and the structure of a rule.

Suricata Rule Development Example 1: Detecting PowerShell Empire
  Suricata Rule Development Part 1
alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"ET MALWARE Possible PowerShell Empire Activity Outbound"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; content:"/"; http_uri; depth:1; pcre:"/^(?:login\/process|admin\/get|news)\.php$/RU"; content:"session="; http_cookie; pcre:"/^(?:[A-Z0-9+/]{4})*(?:[A-Z0-9+/]{2}==|[A-Z0-9+/]{3}=|[A-Z0-9+/]{4})$/CRi"; content:"Mozilla|2f|5.0|20 28|Windows|20|NT|20|6.1"; http_user_agent; http_start; content:".php|20|HTTP|2f|1.1|0d 0a|Cookie|3a 20|session="; fast_pattern; http_header_names; content:!"Referer"; content:!"Cache"; content:!"Accept"; sid:2027512; rev:1;)
The Suricata rule above is designed to detect possible outbound activity from PowerShell Empire, a common post-exploitation framework used by attackers. Let's break down the important parts of this rule to understand its workings.

alert: This is the rule action, indicating that Suricata should generate an alert whenever the conditions specified in the rule options are met.
http: This is the rule protocol. It specifies that the rule applies to HTTP traffic.
$HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any: These are the source and destination IP address specifications. The rule will be triggered when HTTP traffic originates from any port (any) on a host within the $HOME_NET (internal network) and is destined to any port (any) on a host in the $EXTERNAL_NET (external network).
msg:"ET MALWARE Possible PowerShell Empire Activity Outbound": This is the message that will be included in the alert to describe what the rule is looking for.
flow:established,to_server: This specifies the direction of the traffic. The rule is looking for established connections where data is flowing to the server.

PowerShell Empire is an open-source Command and Control (C2) framework. Its agent can be explored via the following repository.https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/agent/agent.ps1#L78
Examine the psempire.pcap file which is located in the /home/htb-student/pcaps directory of this section's target using Wireshark to pinpoint the related requests.
content:"session="; http_cookie;: This is looking for the string "session=" in the HTTP cookie.
pcre:"/^(?:[A-Z0-9+/]{4})*(?:[A-Z0-9+/]{2}==|[A-Z0-9+/]{3}=|[A-Z0-9+/]{4})$/CRi";: This PCRE is checking for base64-encoded data in the Cookie.
A plethora of articles examining PowerShell Empire exist, here is one noting that the cookies utilized by PowerShell Empire adhere to the Base64 encoding standard. https://www.keysight.com/blogs/tech/nwvs/2021/06/16/empire-c2-networking-into-the-dark-side
content:"Mozilla|2f|5.0|20 28|Windows|20|NT|20|6.1"; http_user_agent; http_start;: This matches a specific User-Agent string that includes "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1".
https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/agent/agent.ps1#L78
content:".php|20|HTTP|2f|1.1|0d 0a|Cookie|3a 20|session="; fast_pattern; http_header_names;: This matches a pattern in the HTTP headers that starts with ".php HTTP/1.1\r\nCookie: session=".
content:!"Referer"; content:!"Cache"; content:!"Accept";: These are negative content matches. The rule will only trigger if the HTTP headers do not contain "Referer", "Cache", and "Accept".
This Suricata rule triggers an alert when it detects an established HTTP GET request from our network to an external network, with a specific pattern in the URI, cookie, and user-agent fields, and excluding certain headers.

The above rule is already incorporated in the local.rules file found in the /home/htb-student directory of this section's target. To test it, first, you need to uncomment the rule. Then, execute Suricata on the psempire.pcap file, which is located in the /home/htb-student/pcaps directory.

The local.rules file contains three (3) other rules for detecting Covenant, located directly below the rule we just examined. Invest some time in scrutinizing https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant/blob/master/Covenant/Data/Profiles/DefaultHttpProfile.yaml, the covenant.pcap file using Wireshark, and these newly found rule to comprehend how they work. These rules may yield false-positive results, and hence for optimal performance, it's advisable to integrate them with other detection rules.

Suricata Rule Development Example 3: Detecting Covenant (Using Analytics)
  Suricata Rule Development Part 1
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> any any (msg:"detected by size and counter"; dsize:312; detection_filter: track by_src, count 3 , seconds 10; priority:1; sid:3000001;)
The local.rules file also contains the above rule for detecting Covenant. Let's break down the important parts of this rule to understand its workings.

dsize:312;: This instructs Suricata to look for TCP traffic with a data payload size of exactly 312 bytes.
detection_filter: track by_src, count 3 , seconds 10;: This is a post-detection filter. It says that the rule should keep track of the source IP address (by_src), and it will only trigger an alert if it detects the same rule hit at least 3 times (count 3) within a 10-second window (seconds 10).
This Suricata rule is designed to generate a high-priority alert if it detects at least three instances of TCP traffic within ten seconds that each contain a data payload of exactly 312 bytes, all originating from the same source IP within our network and headed anywhere.

The above rule is already incorporated in the local.rules file found in the /home/htb-student directory of this section's target. To test it, first, you need to uncomment the rule. Then, execute Suricata on the covenant.pcap file, which is located in the /home/htb-student/pcaps directory.

Suricata Rule Development Part 2 (Encrypted Traffic)
In the ever-evolving landscape of network security, we're often faced with a significant challenge: encrypted traffic. Encrypted traffic can pose significant obstacles when it comes to effectively analyzing traffic and developing reliable Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rules.

There are still several aspects we can leverage to detect potential security threats. Specifically, we can turn our attention to the elements within SSL/TLS certificates and the JA3 fingerprint.

SSL/TLS certificates, exchanged during the initial handshake of an SSL/TLS connection, contain a plethora of details that remain unencrypted. These details can include the issuer, the issue date, the expiry date, and the subject (containing information about who the certificate is for and the domain name). Suspicious or malicious domains might utilize SSL/TLS certificates with anomalous or unique characteristics. Recognizing these anomalies in SSL/TLS certificates can be a stepping stone to crafting effective Suricata rules.

Further, we can also utilize the JA3 hash — a fingerprinting method that provides a unique representation for each SSL/TLS client. The JA3 hash combines details from the client hello packet during the SSL/TLS handshake, creating a digest that could be unique for specific malware families or suspicious software. Again, these hashes can be a powerful tool in formulating detection rules for encrypted traffic.

Let's now navigate to the bottom of this section and click on "Click here to spawn the target system!". Then, let's SSH into the Target IP using the provided credentials. The vast majority of the commands covered from this point up to end of this section can be replicated inside the target, offering a more comprehensive grasp of the topics presented.

The rule above triggers an alert upon detecting a TLS session from the external network to the home network, where the payload of the session contains specific byte patterns and meets several conditions. These patterns and conditions correspond to SSL certificates that have been linked to certain variations of the Dridex trojan, as referenced by the SSL blacklist on abuse.ch.

No need to understand the rule in its entirety, but let's break down the important parts of it.

content:"|16|"; content:"|0b|"; within:8;: The rule looks for the hex values 16 and 0b within the first 8 bytes of the payload. These represent the handshake message (0x16) and the certificate type (0x0b) in the TLS record.
content:"|03 02 01 02 02 09 00|"; fast_pattern;: The rule looks for this specific pattern of bytes in the packet, which may be characteristic of the certificates used by Dridex.
content:"|30 09 06 03 55 04 06 13 02|"; distance:0; pcre:"/^[A-Z]{2}/R";: This checks for the 'countryName' field in the certificate's subject. The content match here corresponds to an ASN.1 sequence specifying an attribute type and value for 'countryName' (OID 2.5.4.6). The following PCRE checks that the value for 'countryName' begins with two uppercase letters, which is a standard format for country codes.
content:"|55 04 07|"; distance:0;: This checks for the 'localityName' field in the certificate's subject (OID 2.5.4.7).
content:"|55 04 0a|"; distance:0;: This checks for the organizationName field in the certificate's subject (OID 2.5.4.10).
content:"|55 04 03|"; distance:0; byte_test:1,>,13,1,relative;: This checks for the commonName field in the certificate's subject (OID 2.5.4.3). The following byte_test checks that the length of the commonName field is more than 13.
Please also give this very interesting resource on Dridex SSL certificates a look.
The mentioned OIDs (Object Identifiers) are part of the X.509 standard for PKI and are used to uniquely identify the types of fields contained within certificates.

The above rule is already incorporated in the local.rules file found in the /home/htb-student directory of this section's target. To test it, first, you need to uncomment the rule. Then, execute Suricata on the dridex.pcap file, which is located in the /home/htb-student/pcaps directory.

Zeek Fundamentals
Zeek, as defined by its developers, is an open-source network traffic analyzer. It is typically employed to scrutinize every bit of traffic on a network, digging deep for any signs of suspicious or malicious activity. But, Zeek isn't limited to just that. It can also be a handy tool for troubleshooting network issues and conducting a variety of measurements within a network. Once we deploy Zeek, our defensive cybersecurity teams (or blue teams) can immediately tap into a wealth of log files, which offer an elevated view of all types of network activity. Specifically, these logs contain detailed records of every connection made over the network, along with transcripts of application-layer activities such as DNS queries and responses, HTTP sessions, and more. But Zeek's capabilities extend beyond mere logging. It comes bundled with a suite of functions for analyzing and detecting network activities.

What sets Zeek apart is its highly capable scripting language, which allows users to craft Zeek scripts that are functionally similar to Suricata rules. This powerful feature enables Zeek to be fully customizable and extendable, letting blue team members develop their own logic and strategies for network analysis and intrusion detection.

Considering Zeek's functionality, combined with its ability to run on standard hardware and the powerful scripting language, it becomes clear that we're not looking at another signature-based IDS. Instead, Zeek is a platform that can facilitate semantic misuse detection, anomaly detection, and behavioral analysis..

Zeek's Operation Modes
Zeek operates in the following modes:

Fully passive traffic analysis
libpcap interface for packet capture
Real-time and offline (e.g., PCAP-based) analysis
Cluster support for large-scale deployments
Zeek's Architecture
Zeek's architecture comprises two primary components: the event engine (or core) and the script interpreter.

The event engine takes an incoming packet stream and transforms it into a series of high-level events. In Zeek's context, these events describe network activity in policy-neutral terms, meaning they inform us of what's happening, but they don't offer an interpretation or evaluation of it. For instance, an HTTP request will be transformed into an http_request event. While this event provides all the details of the request, it doesn't offer any judgement or analysis, such as whether a port corresponds to a port known to be used by malware.

Such interpretation or analysis is provided by Zeek's script interpreter, which executes a set of event handlers written in Zeek's scripting language (Zeek scripts). These scripts express the site's security policy, defining actions to be taken upon the detection of certain events.

Events generated by Zeek's core are queued in an orderly manner, awaiting their turn to be processed on a first-come, first-served basis. Most of Zeek's events are defined in .bif files located in the /scripts/base/bif/plugins/ directory. For a more comprehensive list of events, refer to the following resource: https://docs.zeek.org/en/stable/scripts/base/bif/

Zeek Logs
As for Zeek's logging, when we use Zeek for offline analysis of a PCAP file, the logs will be stored in the current directory.

Among the diverse array of logs Zeek produces, some familiar ones include:

conn.log: This log provides details about IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP connections.
dns.log: Here, you'll find the details of DNS queries and responses.
http.log: This log captures the details of HTTP requests and responses.
ftp.log: Details of FTP requests and responses are logged here.
smtp.log: This log covers SMTP transactions, such as sender and recipient details.
Let's consider the http.log as an example. It is chock-full of valuable data like:

host: The HTTP domain/IP.
uri: The HTTP URI.
referrer: The referrer of the HTTP request.
user_agent: The client's user agent.
status_code: The HTTP status code.
For a more exhaustive list of common Zeek logs and their respective fields, refer to the following resource: https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/logs/index.html

It's noteworthy to mention that Zeek, in its standard configuration, applies gzip compression to log files every hour. The older logs are then transferred into a directory named in the YYYY-MM-DD format. When dealing with these compressed logs, alternative tools like gzcat for printing logs or zgrep for searching within logs can come in handy.

You can find examples on how to work with gzip-compressed Zeek logs at this link: https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/06/02/working-with-bro-logs-queries-by-example/

As stated earlier, when interacting with Zeek log files, we can utilize native Unix commands such as cat or grep. However, Zeek also provides a specialized tool known as zeek-cut for handling log files. This utility accepts Zeek log files via standard input using pipelines or stream redirections and then delivers the specified columns to the standard output.

If you're interested in exploring Zeek examples, use cases, and learning the basics of writing Zeek scripts, take a look at the following link: https://docs.zeek.org/en/stable/examples/index.html

For a quick start guide to Zeek, refer to the following link: https://docs.zeek.org/en/stable/quickstart/index.html

Zeek Key Features
Key features that bolster Zeek's effectiveness include:

Comprehensive logging of network activities
Analysis of application-layer protocols (irrespective of the port, covering protocols like HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP, SSH, SSL, etc.)
Ability to inspect file content exchanged over application-layer protocols
IPv6 support
Tunnel detection and analysis
Capability to conduct sanity checks during protocol analysis
IDS-like pattern matching
Powerful, domain-aware scripting language that allows for expressing arbitrary analysis tasks and managing network state over time
Interfacing that outputs to well-structured ASCII logs by default and offers alternative backends for ElasticSearch and DataSeries
Real-time integration of external input into analyses
External C library for sharing Zeek events with external programs
Capability to trigger arbitrary external processes from within the scripting language


Intrusion Detection With Zeek
As already discussed, Zeek, formerly known as Bro, is a powerful network security monitoring tool that allows us to delve deep into our network traffic and extract useful insights.

The flexibility and extensibility of Zeek make it a cornerstone of advanced network-based intrusion detection and investigation. With its rich set of logs and extensive scripting capabilities, we can customize it to suit our specific detection requirements and continuously improve our security posture.

Let's now navigate to the bottom of this section and click on "Click here to spawn the target system!". Then, let's SSH into the Target IP using the provided credentials. The vast majority of the commands covered from this point up to end of this section can be replicated inside the target, offering a more comprehensive grasp of the topics presented.

Let's move forward and explore some examples of detecting intrusions with Zeek.

Intrusion Detection With Zeek Example 1: Detecting Beaconing Malware
Beaconing is a process by which malware communicates with its command and control (C2) server to receive instructions or exfiltrate data. It's usually characterized by a consistent or patterned interval of outbound communications.

By analyzing connection logs (conn.log), we can look for patterns in outbound traffic. These patterns can include repetitive connections to the same destination IP or domain, constant data size in the sent data, or the connection timing. These are all indicative of potential beaconing behavior. Anomalies can be further explored using Zeek scripts specifically designed to spot beaconing patterns.

If we look carefully enough we will notice connections being made to 51.15.197.127:80 approximately every 5 seconds, which is indicative of a malware beaconing.

The psempire.pcap file, which is located in the /home/htb-student/pcaps directory includes traffic related to PowerShell Empire. PowerShell Empire indeed beacons every 5 seconds in its default configuration.

Invest some time in scrutinizing the psempire.pcap file using Wireshark.

We can download the PCAP file into the current directory of either Pwnbox or our own VM as follows.

titagram@htb[/htb]$ scp htb-student@[TARGET IP]:/home/htb-student/pcaps/psempire.pcap .
Intrusion Detection With Zeek Example 2: Detecting DNS Exfiltration
Zeek is also useful when we suspect data exfiltration. Data exfiltration can be difficult to detect as it often mimics normal network traffic. However, with Zeek, we can analyze our network traffic at a deeper level.

Zeek's files.log can be used to identify large amounts of data being sent to an unusual external destination, or over non-standard ports, which may suggest data exfiltration. The http.log and dns.log can also be utilized to identify potential covert exfiltration channels, such as DNS tunneling or HTTP POST requests to a suspicious domain.

Furthermore, Zeek’s ability to reassemble files transferred over the network (regardless of the protocol used) can assist in identifying the nature of the data being exfiltrated.

---SNIP---
Upon close inspection, it becomes evident that the domain letsgohunt.online possesses a significant number of subdomains, similar to cloud providers. However, it's worth noting that interactions with dozens or even hundreds of subdomains are generally not considered typical behavior.

The dnsexfil.pcapng file, which is located in the /home/htb-student/pcaps directory includes traffic related to DNS exfiltration.

Invest some time in scrutinizing the dnsexfil.pcapng file using Wireshark.

We can download the PCAP file into the current directory of either Pwnbox or our own VM as follows.

The output is a bit tricky to analyze. Let's narrow things down by using zeek-cut one more time.

One-liner source: activecountermeasures

  Intrusion Detection With Zeek
titagram@htb[/htb]$ cat conn.log | /usr/local/zeek/bin/zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h orig_bytes | sort | grep -v -e '^$' | grep -v '-' | datamash -g 1,2 sum 3 | sort -k 3 -rn | head -10
10.0.10.100     192.168.151.181 270775912
10.0.10.100     10.0.10.1       0
Let's analyze the command above.

cat conn.log: This command is used to read the content of the conn.log file. The conn.log file, generated by Zeek, provides a record of all connections that have taken place in our network.
/usr/local/zeek/bin/zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h orig_bytes: In this case, we're extracting the id.orig_h (originating host), id.resp_h (responding host), and orig_bytes (number of bytes sent by the originating host) fields.
sort: This command is used to sort the output from the previous command. By default, sort will arrange the lines in ascending order based on the contents of the first field (in this case id.orig_h).
grep -v -e '^$': This command filters out any empty lines. The -v option inverts the selection, the -e option allows for a regular expression, and '^$'` matches empty lines.
grep -v '-': This command filters out lines containing a dash -. In the context of Zeek logs, a dash often represents a missing value or an undefined field.
datamash -g 1,2 sum 3: datamash is a command-line tool that performs basic numeric, textual, and statistical operations. The -g 1,2 option groups the output by the first two fields (the IP addresses of the originating and responding hosts), and sum 3 computes the sum of the third field (the number of bytes sent) for each group.
sort -k 3 -rn: This command sorts the output of the previous command in descending order (-r) based on the numerical value (-n) of the third field (-k 3), which is the sum of orig_bytes for each pair of IP addresses.
head -10: This command is used to limit the output to the top 10 lines, thus showing the top 10 pairs of IP addresses by total bytes sent from the originating host to the responding host.
We notice that ~270 MB (actually a bit less) of data have been sent to 192.168.151.181.

The tlsexfil.pcap file, which is located in the /home/htb-student/pcaps directory includes traffic related to data exfiltration over TLS.

Invest some time in scrutinizing the tlsexfil.pcap file using Wireshark.

We can download the PCAP file into the current directory of either Pwnbox or our own VM as follows.

  Intrusion Detection With Zeek
titagram@htb[/htb]$ scp htb-student@[TARGET IP]:/home/htb-student/pcaps/tlsexfil.pcap .
Intrusion Detection With Zeek Example 4: Detecting PsExec
PsExec, a part of the Sysinternals Suite, is frequently used for remote administration within Active Directory environments. Given its powerful capabilities, it's no surprise that adversaries often prefer PsExec when they carry out remote code execution attacks.

To illustrate a typical attack sequence, let's consider this: an attacker transfers the binary file PSEXESVC.exe to a target machine using the ADMIN$ share, a special shared folder used in Windows networks, via the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol. Following this, the attacker remotely launches this file as a temporary service by utilizing the IPC$ share, another special shared resource that enables Inter-Process Communication.

We can identify SMB transfers and the typical use of PsExec using Zeek's smb_files.log, dce_rpc.log, and smb_mapping.log as follows.
